# **SDLC (SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE)**


### **SDLC MEANING:** 
SDLC is a process that consists of a series of planned activities to develop or alter the Software Products. It is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. It aims to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.

The following figure is a graphical representation of the various stages of a typical SDLC.

### **Planning and Requirement Analysis:** 
This stage gives a clearer picture of the scope of the entire project and the anticipated issues, opportunities, and directives which triggered the project. Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage.

### **Defining Requirements:** 
Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

### **Designing the Product Architecture:** 
SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

### **Building or Developing the Product:**
 In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organised manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle.

### **Testing the Product:**
This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. However, this stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.

 ### **Deployment in the Market and Maintenance:**
  Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate market. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of that organisation. The product may first be released in a limited segment and tested in the real business environment (UAT- User acceptance testing)

  ## **SDLC MODELS:**
  
  There are different different SDLC process models

Waterfall Model

Iterative Model

Spiral Models

V- Model

Big Bang Model

Agile Model

RAD Model

Rapid application development and prototyping Model

### **LAMP**

Lamp Stack: A “LAMP” stack is a group of open source software that is typically installed together in order to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps written in PHP. This term is an acronym which represents the Linux operating system, with the Apache web server. The site data is stored in a MySQL database, and dynamic content is processed by PHP.


### **Chmod command**

Chmod command: chmod stands for change mode. This command is used for changing the mode of access. 
chmod command has the following syntax: chmod [option] mode file.

### **Chown Command**

Chown Command: The chown command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link. The chown command expressions takes the following form: chown [OPTIONS] USER[:GROUP] FILE(s).



### **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.

## **User datagram protocol (UDP)**

User datagram protocol (UDP): User datagram protocol (UDP) operates on top of the Internet Protocol (IP) to transmit datagrams over a network. UDP does not require the source and destination to establish a three-way handshake before transmission takes place.

### **Difference Between TCP and UDP**

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.

Another notable discrepancy with TCP vs UDP is that TCP provides an ordered delivery of data from user to server (and vice versa), whereas UDP is not dedicated to end-to-end communications, nor does it check the readiness of the receiver (requiring fewer overheads and taking up less space).
